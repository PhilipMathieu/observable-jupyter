How to contribute
=================

| The Observable-Jupyter Visualization library has room to grow.
| With your help we can expand the current scope of the library to include
| a wide range of visualizations that will make Observable-Jupyter a one
| stop shop for simple and interactive data visualizations for python.

Creating an Observable Visualization
====================================

| The first thing that you will need to do to contribute a visualization to the 
| library is have a fully functioning visualization in Observable.

| For the visualization to be fully functioning it must be operational from 
| a .ipynb environment using the Observable-Jupyter embed() function. A user must 
| also be able to pass in their own data. 

Creating a .ipynb File
=====================

| Once you have a fully functioning visualization in Observable.
| You should make a .ipynb file that contains the steps needed to run the 
| visualization with the embed() function. 

| The .ipynb notebook should be structured similarly to how the current visualizations are structured.

Creating a Thumbnail and Adding to the Documentation
====================================================

| The final step is to fork or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thomasballinger/observable-jupyter) and follow the [instructions in the docs subdirectory](https://github.com/thomasballinger/observable-jupyter/tree/main/docs).
